       <h2>About Me</h2>
       <p>I grew up in the North East of England and completed my BSc. in Computer Science at Northumbria University.</p>
       <p>When I left University I experimented in a few different roles within Computing until I found myself working as a Frontend Developer for a few companies, a few varied experiences then resulted in me working at an Affiliate Marketing Company within a TechOps role as a Platform Support Engineer helping to keep the Platform running, supporting Clients with customisation requests and bugs/incidents.</p>
       <p>In my free time I love coding, watching Marvel shows/films and keeping healthy with the gym and rock climbing.</p>
       <p>I'm wanting to get involved in more Frontend Development with a focus on Accessibility, User Research and eventually transition into Design/UX.</p>
